This repository contains my MSc Artificial Intelligence coursework project, focused on predicting loan default using supervised machine learning. The project uses the Home Credit Default Risk dataset to build an end-to-end modelling pipeline including:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data preprocessing (missing values, anomalies, encoding, scaling)

Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models

Evaluation using ROC–AUC, recall, and classification metrics

📂 Dataset

The dataset is too large to upload directly to this repository.
You can download it from the following Google Drive link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BHq6eO5BbFvLYERgt8MGVuvC-XL3xx5G?usp=drive_link

Models Used:

1. Logistic Regression (baseline model, interpretable, scaled features)

2. Decision Tree Classifier (captures non-linear patterns, higher recall on defaults)

 Evaluation

Because the dataset is imbalanced, emphasis is placed on:

ROC–AUC

Recall for the default class

Confusion matrix & classification report

Declaration

This work is part of my MSc AI coursework.
All data sources are acknowledged, and the dataset is used for educational purposes only.
